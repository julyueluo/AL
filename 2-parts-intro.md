121 videos, 59 hours 00 minute

For trading price action, the Brooks Trading Course is the most comprehensive source of information on reading and trading price charts. The Price Action Fundamentals sections explain basic chart reading, and well as how and why markets move. Markets are constantly in search of the current fair price, which is always changing. That price is the result of countless variables, and most of them are unknowable, even to very successful traders.

Every market probes up and down to discover how far is too far, which then becomes support and resistance. Once traders understand this and how to spot logical support and resistance levels, they are in a position to begin trading. They also need to learn to watch for certain chart patterns where the probability, risk, and reward give traders an edge. Traders are then ready to study the 2nd part of the course, How to Trade Price Action.

## II How to Trade Price Action

72 videos, 38 hours 58 minutes

Every market is constantly probing up and down. Traders have to assess whether a probe is too far or not far enough. If a trader believes that the market will go further, he will enter with a stop, betting that the breakout beyond that last bar will be successful. If he instead believes that the breakout above the last bar will fail, he will sell at the high of the last bar with a limit order. Knowing how to read charts gives traders a basis for buying or selling above or below the last bar.

Traders need to recognize inflection points. These are times when the market is deciding whether to breakout or reverse. They allow traders to enter with tight stops, and therefore have the smallest risk.

During 10% of the bars on every chart, the market is breaking out and this breakout will be the start of a trend. Breakouts provide the highest probability of profit, but risk/reward ratio is bad. Traders need to understand how to trade breakouts, learning where to take profits and how to trail their stops.

During 90% of the bars on every chart, a trader can make money by buying or selling at any moment if he manages his trade correctly. The key is to understand trade management.

Traders also have to understand how to handle mistakes. Most mistakes are due to taking a bad entry or managing a good entry poorly. However, most trades have at least a 40% chance of failing. A trader has to know what to do when a trade is not doing what he expected. When do you decide that your premise is now wrong and your trade is bad? What do you do once you decide you are in a losing trade?
