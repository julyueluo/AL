## Beginners lose because of psychology and false beliefs

### Captions

This is the first of four vedios about losing because of mistakes.
One of the common reasons that beginners lose is because of psychology and false beliefs.
Most of the money that beginners lose is because they have incorrect beliefs about the market.
They try to apply logic that works outside of trading into the trading world, and the discover that it doesn't work - that if you do what everybody else is doing, you're probably doing the wrong thing.
I want to talk about common mistakes that beginners make and how to avoid them or how to fix them.
Every trader, no matter how good, is going to lose money sometimes because good trades go bad.
There's no 100% certain trade.
I'm going to talk about those in the videos on losing when a good trade goes bad.
That series of videos is shorter because trader lose much more money from mistakes than they do from good trades going bad.
Beginners are ignorant.
By ignorant I don't mean a low IQ.
For example, I'm ignorant of lost of things around the world, especially cultural things in countries where I have not visited.
Ignorant simply means a lack of information.
However, ignorance as a trader is a problem,but it's easy to fix by simplay spending time and being open to ideas that you would not have otherwise considered.
Common ignorant beliefs that lead to beginners losing money?
Perfect trades.
Beginners always believe there's some kind of a perfect setup, and they get mad at me for not telling them my perfect setup.
Perfect trades cannot exist.
Every trade is a combination of risk, reward, and probability, and a perfect trade has great profit, great probability, and very little risk.
That cannot exist.
If a trade has really good risk/reward, it has low probability.
If a trade has very high probabilit, it has very bad risk/reward（usually very low profit, a scalper).
Another thing that you sometimes hear is "noise". Noise is a terrible term.
It implies that the market is behabing randomly.
The market never behaves randomly.
It maybe making moves that are too small for you to trade, but somebody's trading them.
For example, right here you might not want to trade, but there are lots of computers trading.
Some for 1 or 2 tick or 1 or 2 pip scalps, but they're trading.
High frequency trading firms are trading, and other institutions are simply trading because they've determined that this is a good price where they should be selling.
Just because the market is making moves that look too samall for you to make money, does not mean that they are random.
Everything that happens, happens for a reason.
Another common false belief that beginners have is that either the bulls are making money or the bears are making money.
Well, 90% of the time both the bulls and the bears can make money if they use wide stops, scale in, and manage their trade appropriately.
One of the problems that beginners often have is they focus on risk, and they ignore probability and reward.
That results in them sometimes picking bad entries.
Beginners often have small accounts, and because they have small accounts, they don't want to lose their money.
They equate losing the money in that account as the death of their dream of beging a  profitable trader, and therefore they're desperate to not lose that money.
Also their spouses will get mad at them if they lose money.
There is therefore a lot of pressure on them to focus on risk - and unfortunately the result is all they see is risk.
To trade profitably, you also have to consider probability and reward and not simply risk.
If you only look at one variable, you're probably goging to lose money because you need the other two variables as well.
For example, let's say a beginner sells here, thinking that "Oh, it's a pair of big bars. It shouldn't be doing that. We're revesing up and down, up and down, up and down. This should reverse down. I'm going to sell this betting that it's a Buy Climax and it's going to reverse."
If he took that short, at some point in the next bar or two he's going to decide that , well, mayby he bought a breakout that's going to succeed.
However, a lot of times beginners will hold onto the trade, hoping that this is the exception.
He knows at this point or this point the probability is we're going higher, but he'll hold knowing that nothing is 100%, and that means he has a real probability that the market will eventually go his way.
He knows the probability is small, but it exists.
It's real, and therefore he'll ignore the reality that's in front of him - that he took a bad trade and he needs to get out, but he's hoping that the market will go his way.
That's one of the other problems that beginners have.
it's natural that people are hopeful.
If you think about it, it's genetically bred into all of us to be hopeful.
Thousands of years ago, if you did not have food in front of you and you were not hopeful that you could find a deer to shoot and feed your family, you'd just sit around and you would eventually go extinct.
Whereas another person who was out there aggresively looking for food, confident and hoping that he'd find the food and he keeps persisting, he's going to survive.
So being hopeful is a survival skill.
However, it's horrible as a trader.
You cannot make money hoping.
You have to objectively evaluate what's going on, and if you fall back on your natural tendency to be hopefull, you will lose money.
Selling here and watching the market go up, hoping that it will reverse - that is the wrong thing to do.
Let's say a beginner buys here.
He sees a bull trend, a pullback, a breakout of the bull flag, and a pullback from the breakout.
A good-looking buy signal bar; a reasonable buy.
However, he's only thinking about risk.
He doesn't want to take a chance on lising any money, and therefore he uses a tight stop right below the buy signal bar, right here.
That's wrong.
If you're taking this trade, there's only on appropriate stop, and that's down below the bottom of the original leg up.
This is the major Higher Low.
This is the minor Hight Low.
The market could easily fall below this low in a two-legged pullback - one, pullback, two - and it did - and simply become a High 2 bull flag.
Two legs down - one, pullback, two - and the bull trend resumed.
You cannot use a tight stop like that.
The beginner took the good trade, bought above the bull bar, but used a bad stop, and he got stopped out.
It's a small loss, but if you do it two or three times in the course of a day, you're going to end up losing a lot of money.
Another problem that begginners often have is they'll take a trade as a swing, but manage it as a scalp.
The problem with that is if you're taking a swing trade, the probability of success, the probabiliy of making a profitable swing, is usually only about 40%.
We have a very strong rally here.
Traders buying for any reason and using the appropriate stop have maybe a 50% to 60% chance of making a profit.
If a trader buys above this bull bar, he has to use the appropriate stop to get that 50% to 60% probability of success.
This is a major Hight Low, a strong breakout to a new high.
We have breakouts above minor highs here, but not strong breakouts lasting many bars, and therefore this is a minor Higher Low and the market could fall below it and still be in a strong bull trend.
A beginner who took this buy abobe this bull bar and used this stop initially might become upset by the bad follow-through here and decide that he doesn't wat to risk the appropriate amount, and he uses a tighter stop, maybe below the bottom of the buy signal bar, and gets out here.
He ends up losing on a good trade simply because he did not use the appropriate stop.
He dicided to convert it into a scalp.
But for a scalp you probably need 70%-80% probability of success, and this is not a 70% to 80% buy using that stop.
The probability of making money buying above this bull,getting filled here and putting a stop below here?
I would say it's 50/50, and therefore you tighten your stop there, you're going to lose money.
What happens sometimes is the beginner takes the trade and then - let's say this is a 5-minute chart - he has 5minutes, 10 minutes to think about it, and he begins to wonder, "What if it goes against me? it could go all the way back down here, and I don't want to risk that much."
Well if he is unwilling to risk this much he cannot take that trade, because this is where the appropriate stop goes.
If he's entering as a swing, he has to be using the appropriate stop, and he only gets out if his stop is hit or if the market clearly becomes bearish - which it did not.
The opposite is another commom problem that beginners have.
They take a trade as a scalp, and then they manage it as a swing trade, which means far too much risk for too little profit.
Also, beginners should not be scalping because to scalp profitably you have to be able to win 70% or 80% of the time.
Beginners simply cannot do that.
The bulls have a breakout and the market went higher.
